# LED strip configuration:
LED_COUNT = 30  # Number of LED pixels.
LED_PIN = 18  # GPIO pin connected to the pixels (18 uses PWM!).
LED_FREQ_HZ = 800000  # LED signal frequency in hertz (usually 800khz)
LED_DMA = 10  # DMA channel to use for generating signal (try 10)
LED_BRIGHTNESS = 255  # Set to 0 for darkest and 255 for brightest
LED_INVERT = False  # True to invert the signal (when using NPN transistor level shift)

# Create PixelStrip object with appropriate configuration.
strip = PixelStrip(LED_COUNT, LED_PIN, LED_FREQ_HZ, LED_DMA, LED_INVERT, LED_BRIGHTNESS)
# Intialize the library (must be called once before other functions).
