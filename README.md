# About
This is a project done by Diego De La Toba and Ian Sanchez as a final project for CS530. 

# Goal
The primary aim of this project is to design and implement an LED display system using a Raspberry Pi that synchronizes audio input in real-time, offering visually stunning patterns to enhance any audio experience. While digitizing and controlling LED lights may appear mundane, the real-world applications are vital

# Installation for Computer
## Python Dependencies
Code is compatible with Python 2.7 or 3.5. A few Python dependencies must also be installed:
- Numpy
- Scipy (for digital signal processing)
- PyQtGraph (for GUI visualization)
- PyAudio (for recording audio with microphone)
